#A teacher is in the process of generating few reports based on the marks scored by the students of her class in a project based assessment.
#Assume that the marks of her 10 students are available in a tuple. The marks are out of 25.


#Write a python program to implement the following functions:

#find_more_than_average(): Find and return the percentage of students who have scored more than the average mark of the class.
#generate_frequency(): Find how many students have scored the same marks. For example, how many have scored 0, how many have scored 1, how many have scored 3â€¦.how many have scored 25. The result should be populated in a list and returned.
#sort_marks(): Sort the marks in the increasing order from 0 to 25. The sorted values should be populated in a list and returned.

    class_average=sum(list_of_marks)/10
    count_of_studs_scored_above_avg=sum(map(lambda x:x>class_average,list_of_marks))
    
    return (count_of_studs_scored_above_avg/10)*100
    
def sort_marks():
    return sorted(list_of_marks)
