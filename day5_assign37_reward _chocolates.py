#A teacher is conducting a camp for a group of five children. Based on their performance and behavior during the camp, the teacher rewards them with chocolates.

#Write a Python function to

#Find the total number of chocolates received by all the children put together.
#Assume that each child is identified by an id and it is stored in a tuple and the number of chocolates given to each child is stored in a list.
#The teacher also rewards a child with few extra chocolates for his/her best conduct during the camp.
#If the number of extra chocolates is less than 1, an error message "Extra chocolates is less than 1", should be displayed.
#If the given child Id is invalid, an error message "Child id is invalid" should be displayed. Otherwise, the extra chocolates provided for the child must be added to his/her existing number of chocolates and display the list containing the total number of chocolates received by each child.
