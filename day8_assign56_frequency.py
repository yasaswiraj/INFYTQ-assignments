'''
Write a python program that accepts a text and displays a string which contains the word with the largest frequency in the text and the frequency itself separated by a space.

Rules:
The word should have the largest frequency.
In case multiple words have the same frequency, then choose the word that has the maximum length.
Assumptions:
The text has no special characters other than space.
The text would begin with a word and there will be only a single space between the words.'''
